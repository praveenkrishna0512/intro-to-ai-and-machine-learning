Computer Vision, the field that aims to make computers understand and learn visual objects like images, is a hot topic in Machine Learning.

You will be building a __Convolutional Neural Network__ (CNN/ConvNet) and training it on two datasets, *MNIST* and *CIFAR-10*. You'll also learn how to build __data augmentation pipelines__ to enhance your dataset. Finally, you'll look through the eyes of your ConvNet to see __why__ it's making certain predictions."

    "## Concept 1: Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dropout__ (*Srivastava et al., 2014*) is a regularisation technique that randomly shuts off neurons in a given layer. This means the output of the neuron is __zero__. As users, we need to specify a probability value `p` that is the probability of a neuron being shut off or not; there's a $p$ chance of a neuron being shut off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a layer has $n$ neurons/units. Mathematically, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Prob}(i = 1) = p \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Prob}(i = 0) = 1 - p\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $1$ represents neuron $i$ being shut off and $0$ represents neuron $0$ left untouched.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Dropout works\n",
    "By randomly dropping/zero-ing out neurons in a layer, it has a regularising effect on the model. It prevents overfitting because the loss of certain features means the model doesn't accidentally compute very complex functions to model the relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",

So, for example, if I have a training dataset of 200 car images, I can perform augmentations on the 200 images to get 300 more images, thereby making my new training dataset 500 images large.\n",
