    "In class, we discussed about logistic regression, and how it can be useful as a classification algorithm. In this problem set, we get some hands-on practice by implementing logistic regression on a Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. Note that for this problem set, you should only be using the scikit-learn (sklearn) library for the last part (Tasks 5.x) on SVM.\n",

    "We are given a dataset that contains transactions made by credit cards holders in `credit_card.csv`. If we think about what type of data might be included in the input variables under the given context, we might realize that those input variables are likely to include word descriptions, such as shop name or locations. In this problem set, we don't need to worry about language processing as the data are pre-processed to contain only numeric values."

    "Now that you have helped the credit card companies recognize fraudulent transactions, customers are less likely to be charged for items that they did not purchase. They are very satisfied with how well your model performed. They want to offer you a meal, at a restaurant of your choice. You decide to make your choice based on the occupancy of the restaurant. Luckily for you, you have some starting data `restaurant_data.csv` to work with. The dataset provides three input features \"max_capacity\", \"feedback_score\", and \"average_expense\", and an ouptut feature \"occupancy\" that takes the value of \"none\", \"some\", or \"full\"."

    "In this task, you need to implement a fixed learning rate algorithm for multi-class logistic regression. This function takes `X_train`, `y_train`, `max_num_epochs`, `threshold`, `alpha`, and `class_i` as arguments, and output the final `weight_vector` you obtained.
