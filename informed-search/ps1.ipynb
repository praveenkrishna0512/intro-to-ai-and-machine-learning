    "In class, we discussed a range of different searching algorithms. In this problem set, we get some hands-on practice by implementing them for simple logic problems. In particular, we investigate the Missionaries and Cannibals problem discussed in Tutorial 1, as well as a special 2-D Rubic’s Cube problem. Both problems operate in a fully- observable, single-agent, deterministic, episodic, static and discrete environments.\n",

    "## Missionaries and Cannibals\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 1, we discussed the Missionaries and Cannibals (MnC) problem, which is a classic river-crossing logic puzzle. It is not difficult to solve this problem by hand when we have 3 Missionaries and 3 Cannibals. However, the solution becomes less obvious when we generalize the problem to *m* Missionaries and *c* Cannibals where *m* and *c* are some positive integers. To solve this problem, we will implement both Breadth- First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). In the process, we hope that you will conceptually learn the differences in performance between these two search strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Missionaries and Cannibals problem is usually stated as follows: 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold 1 or 2 people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side, without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that same place. You can try it https://javalab.org/en/boat_puzzle_en/ online to test your understanding of the problem. The following is an example of how to help 2 Missionaries and 2 Cannibals cross the river:"

    "## Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, all actions have the same cost (number of steps). BFS is an appropriate strategy to search all possible states. It first expands the root node, and then all the successors of the root node, and their successors. However, a BFS-based tree search algorithm will encounter a large number of repeated states in the tree and waste a lot of time in searching redundant nodes. On the other hand, BFS-based graph search algorithm will check for redundant paths to avoid visiting states more than once. To see the connection between tree search and graph search, you are tasked to implement both BFS tree search and BFS graph search.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS is another commonly seen algorithm in solving AI problems. It always expands the deepest node in the frontier first. DFS proceeds directly to the deepest level of the search tree. The search then “backs up” to the previous node that has unexpanded successors. Your task is to implement both DFS tree search and DFS graph search. You will observe that DFS-based tree search is susceptible to getting stuck in a looped path. In the context of this problem, it could mean keeping 2 Missionaries on the boat, rowing back-and-forth until exhaustion...\n",

Each move will only change the element in the selected row/column, the rest of the cube remains unchanged. For example, if row **1** moves **left**, every element in row 1 will take the position on its left and the head element will go to the tail of this row: [**RGB**] → [**GBR**]. It is clear that it is a recurrent move and consecutively moving left twice is the same as moving right once in a three-by-three cube.

    "## Helper Code\n",
    "To allow you to focus on implementing search instead of having to set up state, the class `Cube` provided in cube.py supports the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `goal_test(state)`: tests whether the provided `state` is the goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `actions(state)`: returns a list of actions at the provided `state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `result(state, action)`: returns the new state after taking `action` from the provide `state`. It is deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `path_cost(c, state1, action, state2)`: returns the accumulated cost of reaching state1 from the initial state and then reaching state2 from state1 by action.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cube problem, the state is an instance of `State` class. It is a hashable type. `Action` in `Cube` is a tuple of an integer representing label and a string representing direction. Your search function should take and only take legal actions to transition to another state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, we have provided a `Node` class for constructing a search tree, a `Stack` class, and a `PriorityQueue` class for your search algorithm in the `utils.py`. You may also choose to implement your own `Node`, `Stack`, and `PriorityQueue` class instead. Our autograder will follow the same import structure as that of the `search.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you choose to override the provided helpers, please include all your code implementations in the template file `search.py` as well as Coursemology .**"

    "## Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "To help with your implementation, we have provided some examples as test cases. These not sufficient to ensure that your code is works correctly, and we encourage you to write your own additional test cases to test and debug your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that your answers may be slightly different from the answers provided since mul- tiple valid solutions sharing the same cost may exist. During grading, your code will be evaluated on hidden test cases on top of the ones we have provided. We will validate your solution and compare the resulting cost to the expected optimal cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we will have hidden test case(s) to check the quality of your heuristic function in the A* search algorithm. Basically, a good heuristic function should provide valuable information to the search, and thus it reduces the number of explorations before finding the best solution. You can keep track of the size of the “reached” state to help you design a better heuristic.\n",
